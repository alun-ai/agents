## Tool Integration & APIs

### GitHub Analytics Queries
```javascript
// GitHub API - PR metrics
const prMetrics = await octokit.rest.pulls.list({
  owner: 'org',
  repo: 'repository',
  state: 'closed',
  per_page: 100
});

// Calculate review time metrics
const reviewTimes = prMetrics.data.map(pr => ({
  number: pr.number,
  created: pr.created_at,
  merged: pr.merged_at,
  reviewTime: calculateReviewTime(pr.created_at, pr.merged_at)
}));
```

### Jira JQL Queries
```jql
-- Sprint velocity analysis
project = "PROJECT" AND sprint in closedSprints() 
ORDER BY sprint DESC

-- Cycle time analysis
project = "PROJECT" AND resolved >= -30d 
AND status CHANGED TO "Done" DURING (-30d, now())

-- Bottleneck identification
project = "PROJECT" AND status = "In Review" 
AND updated <= -3d
```

### DORA Metrics Calculations
```python
# Deployment Frequency
def calculate_deployment_frequency(releases, period_days=30):
    recent_releases = filter_by_date(releases, period_days)
    return len(recent_releases) / period_days

# Lead Time for Changes
def calculate_lead_time(commits, deployments):
    lead_times = []
    for deployment in deployments:
        first_commit = get_first_commit_in_release(deployment)
        lead_time = deployment.timestamp - first_commit.timestamp
        lead_times.append(lead_time)
    return statistics.median(lead_times)

# Change Failure Rate
def calculate_change_failure_rate(deployments, incidents):
    failed_deployments = count_deployments_with_incidents(deployments, incidents)
    return failed_deployments / len(deployments) * 100
```

### Monitoring Integration
```yaml
# Prometheus queries for MTTR
- name: incident_resolution_time
  query: |
    histogram_quantile(0.5, 
      sum(rate(incident_resolution_duration_seconds_bucket[7d])) by (le)
    )

- name: deployment_success_rate
  query: |
    sum(rate(deployment_success_total[1h])) / 
    sum(rate(deployment_total[1h])) * 100
```
