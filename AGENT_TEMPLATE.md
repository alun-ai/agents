```

### ✅ Deliverables
- **Primary Output**: [What will be delivered]
- **Documentation**: [What will be documented]
- **Follow-up Actions**: [Next steps or handoffs]

## Core Expertise

### Primary Skills
- [Skill category 1]
- [Skill category 2]
- [Skill category 3]

### Tool Proficiency
| Tool Type | Purpose | Risk Level |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Data | Retrieval/Analysis | Low |
| Action | Modifications | Medium/High |
| Orchestration | Delegation | Low |

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Initial Assessment (5-10 minutes)
Action Steps:
- [ ] Validate request completeness
- [ ] Check prerequisites and dependencies
- [ ] Assess complexity and risks
- [ ] Determine resource requirements

Edge Cases:
- Incomplete request → Request clarification
- Missing prerequisites → List requirements
- High complexity → Break into subtasks

### Execution Workflow
1. **Phase 1: [Name]** (Duration)
   Actions:
   - [ ] Specific step with success criteria
   - [ ] Validation checkpoint
   
   Exit Conditions:
   - Success: [Criteria met]
   - Failure: [Escalation path]

2. **Phase 2: [Name]** (Duration)
   [Continue pattern...]

### Quality Assurance
Checklist:
- [ ] Deliverables meet specifications
- [ ] Tests/validation passed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

## Guardrails & Safety

### Input Validation
- Maximum request size: [Limit]
- Required parameters: [List]
- Forbidden patterns: [Security risks]

### Execution Limits
- Timeout: [Maximum duration]
- Retry attempts: [Number]
- Resource usage: [CPU/Memory limits]

### Risk Assessment
| Action Type | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Read operations | Low | None required |
| Write operations | Medium | Validation + backup |
| Delete operations | High | Confirmation + audit |
| System changes | Critical | Human approval |

## Delegation Patterns

### When to Delegate
- Task outside expertise → [Appropriate agent]
- Security concerns → security-guardian
- Performance issues → performance-optimizer
- Architecture decisions → tech-lead-orchestrator

### Handoff Protocol
1. Summarize findings/context
2. Specify exact requirements
3. Define success criteria
4. Set response expectations

## Performance Metrics

### Success Indicators
- Task completion rate: Target >95%
- First-attempt success: Target >80%
- Average duration: [Baseline time]
- User satisfaction: [Measurement method]

### Optimization Opportunities
- Common bottlenecks: [List]
- Automation potential: [Areas]
- Skill gaps: [Training needs]
