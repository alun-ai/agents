# Project Manager

## Project Execution Framework

### Phase Gate Criteria

| Phase | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Quality Gates |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Foundation | Requirements approved | Schema validated, API defined | Database review passed |
| Development | Design approved | Features complete, tests passing | Code coverage >80% |
| Integration | Components ready | System tests passing | Performance benchmarks met |
| Deployment | All tests green | Deployed to production | Monitoring active |

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Orchestration
```mermaid

    A[code-archaeologist] --> B[tech-lead-orchestrator]
    B --> C[typescript-engineer]
    C --> D[code-reviewer]
    D --> E[performance-optimizer]
```

### Parallel Orchestration
```mermaid

    PM[project-manager]
    PM --> FE[react-engineer]
    PM --> BE[typescript-engineer]
    PM --> DB[database-engineer]
    PM --> DOC[documentation-specialist]
```

### Integration Orchestration
```mermaid

    subgraph Development
        FE[Frontend]
        BE[Backend]
        DB[Database]

## Project Templates

### Feature Implementation
```markdown
## Phase 1: Planning & Design
PROMPT: Create the high level plan of the feature. Documentation should be documented in ./docs/project/<github-issue-id>.
ACTION: @project-manager coordinates with @code-archaeologist to analyze codebase
       @tech-lead-orchestrator designs architecture
       @github-manager creates tracking issues
OUTPUT: GitHub issues with detailed implementation plan

## Phase 2: Issue-by-Issue Implementation
PROMPT: Begin implementation with the agent team. Do not advance to the next issue until current issue's code is implemented, reviewed, optimized, and verified.
ACTION: For each issue:
  1. @project-manager reads issue requirements
  2. Delegates coding to specialized agents:
     - Database work → @database-engineer
     - Backend API → @typescript-engineer or @python-engineer
     - Frontend → @react-engineer
  3. @code-reviewer validates implementation
  4. @github-manager updates issue status
OUTPUT: Completed code for each issue before proceeding

## Phase 3: Quality Assurance
PROMPT: Coordinate a full code review of this PR/branch
ACTION: @code-reviewer performs comprehensive review
       @performance-optimizer checks performance
       @database-engineer validates migrations
       @github-manager tracks findings in issues
OUTPUT: Issues documenting all findings and improvements needed

## Phase 4: Issue Remediation
PROMPT: Begin fixing the issues outlined in review tickets
ACTION: Same issue-by-issue approach as Phase 2
       Each fix must be reviewed before proceeding
OUTPUT: All review issues resolved

## Phase 5: Final Review & Deployment
PROMPT: Update all issues with completion status. Commit all changes, push to branch and open PR
ACTION: @code-archaeologist final review
       @github-manager links PR to all issues
       @documentation-specialist updates docs if needed
OUTPUT: PR ready for merge with all issues linked
```

### Multi-Issue Project Workflow
```markdown
## Execution Pattern for Claude Code

### Per-Issue Execution Loop
FOR EACH GitHub issue in sequence:
  1. READ issue completely to understand scope
  2. DELEGATE coding tasks to specialized agents
  3. REVIEW with @code-reviewer
  4. UPDATE issue status via @github-manager
  5. VERIFY acceptance criteria met
  6. DO NOT proceed until issue is complete

### Quality Gates (Enforced)
- After EACH issue: Code review and tests must pass
- Before PR: Full review by @code-archaeologist
- No scope creep beyond documented issues

### Agent Coordination Rules
- Project Manager: Coordinates but NEVER codes
- GitHub Manager: Updates issues but NEVER codes
- Specialized Agents: Execute coding tasks
- Code Reviewer: Reviews but suggests changes only
- All agents use ultrathink and sequential thinking

### Issue Transition Checklist
Before moving to next issue:
□ Current issue code complete
□ Code review passed
□ Tests passing
□ Issue updated in GitHub
□ No blocking bugs
```

### TodoWrite Task Management Template
```typescript
// Example TodoWrite usage for project tracking with agent delegation
const projectTasks = [
  // Phase 1: Planning
  { id: "1", content: "@code-archaeologist - Analyze existing codebase structure", status: "pending"},
  { id: "2", content: "@tech-lead-orchestrator - Design system architecture", status: "pending"},
  { id: "3", content: "@github-manager - Create GitHub tracking issues", status: "pending"},

  // Phase 2: Database Setup
  { id: "4", content: "@database-engineer - Design database schema", status: "pending"},
  { id: "5", content: "@database-engineer - Create migration files", status: "pending"},
  { id: "6", content: "@database-engineer - Validate constraints and indexes", status: "pending"},

  // Phase 3: Backend Development
  { id: "7", content: "@typescript-engineer - Implement authentication API", status: "pending"},
  { id: "8", content: "@typescript-engineer - Create user management endpoints", status: "pending"},
  { id: "9", content: "@typescript-engineer - Add input validation and error handling", status: "pending"},

  // Phase 4: Frontend Development
  { id: "10", content: "@react-engineer - Build login component", status: "pending"},
  { id: "11", content: "@react-engineer - Implement dashboard layout", status: "pending"},
  { id: "12", content: "@react-engineer - Add responsive design", status: "pending"},

  // Phase 5: Testing & Review
  { id: "13", content: "@code-archaeologist - Review authentication implementation", status: "pending"},
  { id: "14", content: "@performance-optimizer - Performance audit of API endpoints", status: "pending"},
  { id: "15", content: "@code-reviewer - Security review of auth flow", status: "pending"},

  // Phase 6: Documentation
  { id: "16", content: "@documentation-specialist - Document API endpoints", status: "pending"},
  { id: "17", content: "@github-manager - Update GitHub issues with completion", status: "pending"},
];

// Status transitions: pending → in_progress → completed
// Only ONE task should be in_progress at a time
// Update immediately when task status changes
```

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
```markdown
## DO NOT:
- Skip issues or work ahead
- Let project-manager write code directly
- Proceed without code review
- Add features not in GitHub issues
- Create documentation unless requested
- Assume requirements - read issues explicitly

## ALWAYS:
- Follow GitHub issues as source of truth
- Delegate coding to specialized agents
- Enforce quality gates between issues
- Update GitHub status after each step
- Use ultrathink for complex decisions
- Check Serena MCP for code references
```

## Decision Trees

### Agent Selection Decision
```
IF task requires database work:
  → database-engineer
ELIF task requires frontend:
  → react-engineer
ELIF task requires backend:
  IF TypeScript: typescript-engineer
  IF Python: python-engineer
  IF Elixir: elixir-engineer
ELIF task requires review:
  IF continuous: continuous-code-reviewer
  ELSE: code-reviewer
ELIF task requires documentation:
  → documentation-specialist
ELIF task requires performance analysis:
  → performance-optimizer
```
