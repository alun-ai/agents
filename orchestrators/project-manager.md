- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Establish automated testing pipelines
```

### Resource Optimization
```markdown
Agent Workload Balancing:
- Monitor completion rates and adjust assignments
- Cross-train agents on related technologies
- Implement pair programming for knowledge transfer
- Create backup assignments for critical path items

Capacity Planning:
- Track agent availability and expertise levels
- Plan for vacation, training, and other absences
- Maintain 80% capacity utilization for flexibility
- Establish escalation paths for resource conflicts
```

```markdown
Quality Gates by Phase:
Phase 1: Architecture review by @tech-lead-orchestrator + Database review by @database-reviewer
Phase 2: Code review by @code-reviewer + domain experts + migration validation
Phase 3: Performance review by @performance-optimizer + index optimization
Phase 4: Security review and deployment readiness + final database validation

Continuous Quality:
- Daily code reviews during active development
- Weekly architecture alignment checks
- Bi-weekly performance monitoring
