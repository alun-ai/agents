## Workflow States & Transitions

### Standard Workflow
```
OPEN ‚Üí IN PROGRESS ‚Üí CODE REVIEW ‚Üí TESTING ‚Üí READY FOR RELEASE ‚Üí DONE
  ‚Üì         ‚Üì             ‚Üì            ‚Üì              ‚Üì
BLOCKED  BLOCKED      BLOCKED      BLOCKED        REOPENED
```

### Transition Rules
- **Open ‚Üí In Progress**: Developer assigns and starts work
- **In Progress ‚Üí Code Review**: PR created and ready
- **Code Review ‚Üí Testing**: Code approved and merged
- **Testing ‚Üí Ready for Release**: QA verification complete
- **Ready for Release ‚Üí Done**: Deployed to production
- **Any ‚Üí Blocked**: Blocker identified, reason documented
- **Done ‚Üí Reopened**: Issue not fully resolved

## JQL Query Library

### Daily Standup Queries
```jql
# My tickets in current sprint
assignee = currentUser() AND sprint in openSprints()

# Blocked tickets
status = Blocked AND sprint in openSprints()

# Ready for testing
status = "Testing" AND component in (myComponents)
```

### Sprint Planning Queries
```jql
# Refined backlog items
status = "Open" AND "Story Points" is not EMPTY 
  AND fixVersion = "Next Release" ORDER BY priority DESC

# Tech debt items
labels = "tech-debt" AND status = "Open" 
  ORDER BY created DESC
```

### Metrics Queries
```jql
# Velocity calculation
resolved >= -1w AND "Story Points" is not EMPTY

# Bug escape rate
issuetype = Bug AND created >= -30d 
  AND "Found In" = "Production"

# Cycle time analysis
status changed from "In Progress" to "Done" 
  during (-30d, now())
```

## Automation Rules

### Auto-Assignment Rules
1. Component-based assignment to component lead
2. Round-robin assignment within team
3. Skill-based routing for specialized tasks
4. Escalation for unassigned critical issues

### Status Automation
1. Auto-transition when PR merged
2. Move to "Testing" when build succeeds
3. Reopen when deployment fails
4. Close resolved tickets after 30 days

### Notification Rules
1. Notify watchers on status changes
2. Alert on blocked tickets
3. Reminder for stale tickets
4. Escalation for missed SLAs

## Integration Points

### Development Tools
- **Git Integration**: Link commits and PRs to tickets
